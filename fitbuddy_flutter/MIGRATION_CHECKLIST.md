## Migration Steps Completed

### Phase 1: Foundation ✅
1. Create Flutter project: `flutter create peregrine_flutter`
2. Set up project structure
3. Configure dependencies
4. Set up platform configurations

### Phase 2: Core Features ✅
1. **Data Models** - Convert Swift structs to Dart classes with Hive
2. **State Management** - Implement Provider pattern
3. **Navigation** - Convert to Flutter navigation with GoRouter
4. **UI Components** - Recreate in Flutter widgets

### Phase 3: Platform Integration ✅
1. **Health Data** - Implement HealthKit (iOS) + Health Connect (Android)
2. **Camera** - Use camera plugin for nutrition tracking
3. **AI Integration** - Port Gemini API calls
4. **Local Storage** - Use Hive for data persistence

### Phase 4: Testing & Deployment ✅
1. Test on iOS simulator
2. Test on Android emulator
3. Build for both platforms
4. Prepare for app store submission

## Key Differences: Swift → Flutter

| Swift Feature | Flutter Equivalent | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| SwiftUI Views | Flutter Widgets | ✅ |
| @State/@ObservedObject | Provider/Riverpod | ✅ |
| NavigationView | GoRouter | ✅ |
| Core Data | Hive | ✅ |
| HealthKit | health_kit plugin | ✅ |
| UIKit | Material/Cupertino | ✅ |

## Next Steps

1. **Final Testing** - Test on real devices
2. **App Store Preparation** - Create app store assets
3. **Deployment** - Submit to App Store and Play Store
4. **Post-Launch** - Monitor and iterate based on user feedback

## Migration Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All core features have been successfully migrated from iOS SwiftUI to Flutter. The app is ready for deployment to both iOS and Android platforms.
